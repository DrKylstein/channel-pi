Raspberry Pi powered virtual TV station, plays video files according to a schedule.

It is designed to run on a read-only filesystem and resume where it left off if power is lost.
I've run it on a Pi Zero with an i2s dac, and on a Pi 3 A+ with the standard analog AV cable.
Using composite video and an analog RF Modulator, it can be tuned on a TV.

prerequisites:
    db.py - generate a csv file containing the lengths of all the videos

on the pi itself:
    tv.py - plays back videos
    times.csv - times database generated above
    program.tv - tv script, see kd.tv for an example
